# Self Driving Car
Problem is to implement a self driving car's steering wheel component with front board video as sensory input. The software component of deciding the angle of rotation of the steering wheel according to the curvature of the road is implemented in this project.Various deep learning methods are used and their performances is compared in this domain. Major Goal was be to reduce the training log loss and improve accuracy.

Folder 2DCNN & 3DCNN consist of jupyter notebook to train the model and model.py file that consist of model's architecture written with tensorflow api

Folder 2DCNN-LSTM consist of jupyter notebook to train model. Model's architecture is defined inside this notebook written with tensorflow keras api.

run.py is opnecv implemnetation to run the best model to predict the wheel's angle on given input sequence of images.
